## 🐍 Python Library Install Assistant (PLIS.exe)

**PLIS** is a lightweight graphical assistant that helps users install the most popular Python libraries with a single click — no need to open CMD, no pip commands, no hassle.

---

### 🚀 What is PLIS?

**PLIS** (Python Library Install Assistant) is a modern, beginner-friendly tool that simplifies the installation of Python libraries. It automatically checks if Python and `pip` are installed on the system, and if not, it can install them silently in the background. The program provides a smooth GUI with clear progress indicators, real-time status for each library, and fully offline support after initial setup.
